Devin's modpacks, [Additive](https://github.com/intergrav/Additive) and [Adrenaline](https://github.com/intergrav/Adrenaline), require you to use a third-party launcher to install and run them, which can be a bit of a hassle for some users. This program aims to solve this issue by allowing you to easily install either modpack onto the default Minecraft launcher, without requiring any third-party tools.
